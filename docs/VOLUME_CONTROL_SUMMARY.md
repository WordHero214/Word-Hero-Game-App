# 🔊 Volume Control - Quick Summary

## What Was Added

A floating volume controller in the game screen that lets students adjust background music volume during gameplay.

## Why It Was Needed

## Key Features

✅ **Volume Button** - Top bar with dynamic icon (🔇/🔉/🔊)  
✅ **Slider Control** - Smooth 0-100% volume adjustment  
✅ **Quick Presets** - Off (0%), Low (15%), High (50%)  
✅ **Lower Default** - Changed from 25% to 15% for better audio clarity  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Volume changes instantly without lag  
✅ **Visual Feedback** - Gradient slider shows current level

## How to Use

1. Click the 🔊 button in the top bar during gameplay
2. Adjust slider or use quick presets
3. Recommended: Use "Low" or "Off" for Medium mode

## Files Changed

- `masteringword-main/App.tsx` - Added volume control logic and UI
- `masteringword-main/index.html` - Added custom slider CSS styling

## Result

Students can now hear word pronunciations clearly while still enjoying background music at their preferred volume level!
