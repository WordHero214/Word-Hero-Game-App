# Descriptive Hints Update for HARD Mode

## Overview
Enhanced all 20 HARD mode word hints to be more descriptive and helpful for students below Grade 6, replacing generic letter count hints with meaningful clues.

## Changes Made

### Before
- Hints only showed letter counts: "This word has 13 letters"
- Not helpful for younger students (below Grade 6)
- Students would get lost and couldn't guess answers

### After
All 20 HARD words now have descriptive hints that include:
- **Word parts/prefixes**: "Starts with DE-", "Has CYCLE in it"
- **Pronunciation guides**: "Sounds like 'POLL-U-SHUN'"
- **Word meaning breakdowns**: "BIO means life, DIVERSITY means variety"
- **Concrete examples**: "Math with times tables like 3 × 4 = 12"
- **Context clues**: "When people cut down many trees in the forest"

## Example Improvements

### DEFORESTATION
- **Old**: "This word has 13 letters"
- **New**: "When people cut down many trees in the forest. Starts with DE- and ends with -TION"

### POLLUTION
- **Old**: "This word has 9 letters"
- **New**: "When air, water, or land becomes dirty and harmful. Sounds like 'POLL-U-SHUN'"

### BIODIVERSITY
- **Old**: "This word has 12 letters"
- **New**: "Many different types of plants and animals. BIO means life, DIVERSITY means variety"

### MULTIPLICATION
- **Old**: "This word has 14 letters"
- **New**: "Math with times tables like 3 × 4 = 12. Has the word MULTIPLY (times) in it"
